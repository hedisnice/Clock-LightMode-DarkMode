# Clock-LightMode-DarkMode

Your JavaScript code is a practice exercise that performs various functions related to displaying time on a website page and changing the background color and text color of the page. The code utilizes JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements.

The JavaScript Date object API is employed to fetch the current time and time zone, specifically "Asia/Bangkok" (Bangkok), which is then displayed in the specified format.

Additionally, there are Moon and Sun buttons. When clicked, these buttons alter the background color of the website page and text color to black or white, respectively. This transformation is achieved by adjusting the background color, text color, and color of various elements on the page.
